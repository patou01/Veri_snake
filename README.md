# Veri_snake
Verilog code to run a basic snake game on a terasic DE0-nano using the FPGA4u shield.
## Introduction
I wrote this when learning HDL out of curiosity. In 2nd year we were given an assignment for which we had to make a snake game using logic gates on Simulink, so I thought it'd be fun to do it in Verilog now.
It is made to run on a [Terasic DE0-Nano][prismino] with an [FPGA4u][FPGA4u] shield.

You can find the required source files in this repo.
This is a very basic version, I might have butchered the logic here and there, and it is far from perfect code. It was learnt and done in less than 2 weeks.

## Modules

### Screen driver


### Inputs


### Snake



### Food generator


### Point counter








## Thanks
I'd like to thank the [LAP][LAP] for lending those boards to [Robopoly][Robopoly], allowing me to have access to this hardware.


## Licences
I don't care too much, but some say you should, so I just typed in "which licence should I use" on Google which said MIT. So here goes.
